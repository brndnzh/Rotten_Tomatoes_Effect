# The Rotten Tomatoes Effect

This is my analysis on the Rotten Tomatoes Effect and a model I created to predict film earnings using data from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. The original Jupyter Notebook script is available in this repository with the entire analysis and the model, created using Scikit-Learn. HTML and PDF versions of the output of the script are also available for easier viewing. Attached is also a Word Document with links to the original sources for downloading the original data if one wanted to run the Jupyter Notebook script themselves.
