# The Rotten Tomatoes Effect

This is my analysis on the Rotten Tomatoes Effect and a model I created to predict film earnings using data from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. The original Jupyter Notebook script is available in this repository where the model, created in Scikit-Learn is available. HTML and PDF versions of the output of the script are also available for easier viewing of the entire analysis. Attached is also Word Document with links to the original sources for downloading the original data if one wanted to run the Jupyter Notebook script themselves.
